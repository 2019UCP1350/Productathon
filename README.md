<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
* To promote Sanskrit language in the country of its origin, we decided to build an interactive and user-friendly website. It enables one to learn the basics of Sanskrit easily. It has following features:
* To learn Sanskrit, it has two levels(Level -1 & Level-2). 
* In Level-1, one can learn about the alphabets of Sanskrit.
* In Level-2, one can learn about the common words found in Sanskrit Language. 
* A feature to translate words from Sanskrit to English language.
* A feature to get the pronunciation of words in Sanskrit.

We believe that a website having above listed features will certainly help a user which is new to an ancient language like Sanskrit.
